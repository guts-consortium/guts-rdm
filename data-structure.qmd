## Data structure

GUTS' data structure will be based on BIDS principles, with some small adjustments to ensure a logical workflow. Below you can find a preliminary version of the GUTS data structure.

The data structure consists of individual-level (neuroimaging) and group-level data, placed in respectively the guts-bids folder and the guts-phenotype folder. **Note that the data structure is not final yet, it may undergo changes in the (near) future.**
