# GUTS RDM Handbook

This is the GitHub repository with the source code and content for the **Research Data Management (RDM) Handbook** of the Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) consortium.

The goal of the GUTS RDM Handbook is to bring everything about data collection, data management, and data handling in the GUTS consortium together in a central and easily searchable place. First and foremost, the goal is to facilitate data management within the GUTS consortium. Second, we hope that this handbook might be useful for other projects. We are building upon resources and wisdom of many others, we hope to pay it forward by making this resource openly available.

## Getting started

If you are here to read the Handbook, you are probably mostly satisfied with browsing the [published RDM Handbook](https://eduardklap.github.io/guts-rdm){.uri}. In case you are here to contribute to the Handbook, read on for some more information about the technical background.

### Using Quarto and RStudio

The RDM Handbook is build using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). All pages are authored in Quarto documents (with .qmd extension), which are then automatically rendered to html pages. If you want to contribute to the Handbook, you can directly edit the Quarto documents and create a pull request.

The most convenient way of working with Quarto is using Rstudio. RStudio v2022.07 and later includes support for editing and preview of Quarto documents.
