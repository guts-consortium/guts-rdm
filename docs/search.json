    "text": "9.2 Requesting Yoda workspace and uploading to Yoda\nIn the three steps below, we explain how you can request a personal workspace for Yoda, sign into that workspace and upload your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Requesting Yoda workspace\n\n\n\nRequesting a Yoda workspace differs per location and is handled by each university differently. The most important thing is that the workspaces that will be created, for all data collected in a specific location, follow the same naming convention. In total four workspaces will be needed per location (two for the pilot and two for the main study), which are divided in the following ways:\n\nA distinction will be made between pilot data and main study data\nWithin these two categories, a distinction will be made between raw data and “up to guts standard” data\n\nRaw data is all the data you deposit immediately/as soon as possible after collection, unaltered.\nThe “up to guts standard” data includes data that is converted to the standard required to conduct research. More information on converting your data to GUTS standards can be found in the following chapter.\n\n\nAll workspaces within Yoda will start with the prefix research-. In the table below you will find the final names of the workspaces for each location. They follow these naming conventions:\n\nWorkspaces for the pilot will follow the convention: guts-pilot-[location] and then an added -raw for the raw data workspace\nWorkspaces for the main study will follow the convention: guts-[location] and then an added -raw for the raw data workspace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Location\nPilot workspace name\nMain study workspace name\n\n\nWP1 Amsterdam-VU\nresearch-guts-pilot-vu-raw\nresearch-guts-pilot-vu\nresearch-guts-vu-raw\nresearch-guts-vu\n\n\nWP1 Rotterdam-EUR\nresearch-guts-pilot-eur-raw\nresearch-guts-pilot-eur\nresearch-guts-eur-raw\nresearch-guts-eur\n\n\nWP2 Leiden-UL\nresearch-guts-pilot-lei-raw\nresearch-guts-pilot-lei\nresearch-guts-lei-raw\nresearch-guts-lei\n\n\nWP3 Amsterdam-UVA\nresearch-guts-pilot-uva-raw\nresearch-guts-pilot-uva\nresearch-guts-uva-raw\nresearch-guts-uva\n\n\nWP4 Utrecht-UU\nresearch-guts-pilot-uu-raw\nresearch-guts-pilot-uu\nresearch-guts-uu-raw\nresearch-guts-uu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Yoda sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you go to your local Yoda web portal you can find the “Sign in” button in the top right. This takes you to a page where you have to sign in with your institutional email (the same email you would use for other SURFconext or SRAM logins). NOTE: You are only able to sign in if you have been added to a workspace!\n\nThis sends you on to the SURFconext/SRAM sign in page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Uploading data\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have signed in you will find that the ‘Research’ and ‘Vault’ buttons have appeared in the top left of the screen.\n\nIf you requested a workspace using the same email address you used to sign in, or you have been added to that workspace, you can find it by clicking on Research on the Top left.\n\nIn this overview find your research folder (in this example “research-guts-dummy”).\n\nHere you can find the data that you have uploaded previously. We will highlight two major actions here and explain them in more detail later:\n\nUploading data: Using the “Upload” button in the top right, you can upload files/folders. You can also drag and drop files directly from your own system into the Yoda portal. There are also other options to upload data, like using curl. An example on using curl can be found in the following chapter. For more information regarding this example of using curl you can visit this page on github.\n\n\n\nGroup management: Using the “Go to group manager” button in the top right, you invite members (if you are the group manager, which you are if you requested the workspace) and give different permissions to members (read/write rights etc.)."

    "text": "Good and structured file names will help you and your collaborators to easily navigate the content and status of files in your project. Within the GUTS consortium we use file naming conventions from the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for MRI and related files. For all other files, we suggest the following best practices:\nIn general, good file names are (see also Klapwijk (2023)):\n\nMachine-readable:\n\nUse not much more than letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores. Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, and case sensitivity\n\nFor example, paper_flanker-task_draft01.docx is preferred over paper “flanker task” draft01(1).docx\n\nDeliberately use delimiters. Use a hyphen (-) to mean “different words that are part of the same chunk”, and underscore (_) to separate different chunks of metadata\n\nFor example, file names in the BIDS specification nicely follow this principle: the file sub-01_ses-02_task-feedback_run-01.nii contains instances of the “subject”, “ses(sion)”, “task” an “run” entities, making it evident from the filename alone that it contains the nii (nifti) feedback task data for run 01 from session 02 of subject 01\n\n\nHuman-readable:\n\nGood file names provide useful clues to the content, status and version of a file, uniquely identify a file and help in classifying and sorting files\nChoose keywords and file names that are sufficiently descriptive, e.g., analysis01_descriptive-statistics.R,analysis02_preregistered-analysis.R\n\nMake sorting and searching easy:\n\nUse YYYY-MM-DD date format (ISO 8601 standard)\nTo order files put date or number first, e.g., 2019-01-01_original-analysis.R, 2019-12-01_minor-changes-to-original.R, 01_original-analysis.R, 02_minor-changes-to-original.R\nInclude the version of the file, e.g., methodology-section _v1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKlapwijk, Eduard. 2023. “Best Practices for Documenting and Organizing Research Projects,” January. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.7551576."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As mentioned in the general naming conventions section, naming should be both human as well as machine readable. Most of this can be solved by using BIDS as explained in the previous section, however there are some GUTS-specific naming conventions that need to be adhered to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures\n\n\n\n\n\nTo adhere to the machine-readable condition, file names of measure data should always include \"_task-[short name]_\". The short name (see codebook) of the measure should be used to ensure each collection site uses the same measure name. For example, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index has short name “iri”. Its filename will therefore always include \"_task-iri_\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSessions\n\n\n\n\n\nSessions will be named according to the BIDS standard, meaning that they start with 'ses-'.\nGUTS is a ten-year project; data collection will start in year 2.\nCohorts A, B, D will collect data in year 2, 5 and 8. Their respective sessions will be called:\n\n'ses-01', 'ses-02', 'ses-03'.\n\nCohort D will also collect data between session 1 and 2, and between session 2 and 3:\n\n`ses-01a', 'ses-02a'\n\nCohort C will collect data twice a year in year 2 and 3:\nFor the first sessions of a year:\n\n'ses-01', 'ses-02'\n\nFor the second measurement of a year, which take place 6 months after the first sessions:\n\n`ses-01a', 'ses-02a'\n\nPilot\nThe pilot sessions will be named 'ses-pilot'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject IDs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subject ID naming convention differs slightly for each of the data storage locations. To prevent accidental overlap between collected data between WPs, an abbreviation of the location will be added to each subject ID, as can been seen below.\nAs approximately 400-800 subjects will participate at each location, we advise to use a number between 0 and 800. The subject id number should always consists of three numbers, e.g., subject 1 will get the number 001, subject 15 will get the number 015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData storage location\nSubject ID naming convention\nExample\n\n\n\n\nErasmus University Rotterdam (EUR)\nsub-guts-eur-#\nsub-guts-eur-001\n\n\nLeiden University (LEI)\nsub-guts-lei-#\nsub-guts-lei-001\n\n\nVrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU)\nsub-guts-vu-#\nsub-guts-vu-001\n\n\nUniversiteit van Amsterdam (UVA)\nsub-guts-uva-#\nsub-guts-uva-001\n\n\n\nSubject IDs pilot\nSubject IDs during the pilot will follow the convention: 'sub-guts-pilot-[location]-#'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile names\n\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent duplicate file names, each data collection site has to add their abbreviation to the file name. For brain imaging data, the location will be included in the subjectid in the file name. For other data the location needs to be added separately. Additionally, file names should include the session and task as described earlier.\nParticipant-level files (individual files) follow the naming convention:\nsub-[subjectid]_ses-[session]_task-[short-name]\nGroup-level files (file with all participants merged) follow the naming convention:\nguts-[location]_ses-[session]_task-[short-name]\nRaw vs processed files\nUltimately, it’s most import that the processed files follow the correct naming conventions, as we won’t be able to run our scripts otherwise. However, future you will be very grateful if you ensure that the raw output also follows a clear and consistent naming convention, as this will facilitate data-processing.\nTherefore, if you are able to fill in a subject name/session/task name when setting up a task (e.g., (f)MRI, EEG, E-Prime, Dynanometer, etc.), please adhere to the naming conventions. Note that some measures (e.g., MRI) might not have the option to fully decide on output file naming beforehand.\nBelow you can find some examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nRaw\nRaw naming conventions\nProcessed\nProcessed naming conventions\n\n\n\n\nQualtrics - GUTS wide\n.sav\n2024-02-26_guts-lei_ses-02_quests-guts-wide_raw.sav\n.tsv\nguts-lei_ses-02_task-iri.tsv\nguts-lei_ses-02_task-ypi.tsv\n\n\nQualtrics - Cohort specific\n.sav\n2024-02-26_guts-lei_ses-02_quests-guts-specific_raw.sav\n.tsv\nguts-lei_ses-02_task-iri.tsv\nguts-lei_ses-02_task-ypi.tsv\n\n\nESM\n.csv\n2024-02-26_guts-eur_ses-01_esm_raw.csv/sub-guts-eur-001_ses-01_esm_raw.csv\n.tsv\nguts-eur_ses-01_task-esm-pressure.tsv\n\n\n(f)MRI\n.nii\nsub-guts-eur-014_ses-03_task-fmri-sddt_run-01_raw.nii\n.nii\nsub-guts-eur-014_ses-03_task-fmri-sddt_run-01.nii\n\n\n\n.par\nsub-guts-eur-014_ses-03_task-fmri-sddt_run-01_raw.par\n-\n\n\n\n\n.rec\nsub-guts-eur-014_ses-03_task-fmri-sddt_run-01_raw.rec\n-\n\n\n\nEEG\n.bdf\nsub-guts-eur-027_ses-01_task-eeg-social-flanker_raw.bdf\n.bdf\nsub-guts-eur-027_ses-01_task-eeg-social-flanker.bdf\n\n\nDynanometer\n.csv?\nsub-guts-eur-028_ses-03_task-dyno-prosocial-effort_raw.csv\n.tsv\nguts-eur_ses-03_task-dyno-prosocial-effort.tsv\n\n\nBehavioral\n.edat3\nsub-guts-vu-002_ses-02_task-sddt_raw.edat3\n.tsv\nguts-vu_ses-02_task-sddt.tsv\n\n\n\n.txt\nsub-guts-vu-002_ses-02_task-sddt_raw.txt\n-\n-\n\n\nPhysiological\nlabels\nsub-guts-uva-005_ses-01_task-saliva-testo_t0\nsub-guts-uva-007_ses-01_task-saliva-testo_t30\n.tsv\nguts-uva_ses-01_saliva-testo.tsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\n\n\n\n\n\nWe propose the following naming conventions for tabular data.

This will encompass magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, questionnaire data (e.g. behavioral and social measures), and genetic data. A number of similar measures will be collected across all cohorts. This RDM Handbook and all other efforts to streamline the organization of the data within the GUTS consortium is all aimed to make working with this data as seamless as possible.\nOpen Science and collaboration are very important pillars of the GUTS project. Good data management is vital to facilitate collaboration within the consortium, and eventually also with researchers outside the consortium.\nWe are planning to use a “FAIR from the start” approach, which means that we are striving to unify data collection and data processing from the start. This will allow us to build a database including a metadata explorer that shows the data in various ways. In this way, once the data is collected and processed, it can be unlocked by researchers to analyse it thoroughly and safely.\n\n\n\n\nBriney, Kristin, Heather Coates, and Abigail Goben. 2020. “Foundational Practices of Research Data Management.” Research Ideas and Outcomes 6 (July): e56508. https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e56508."

Questions that will be answered in a DMP cover every part of the research cycle, including legal arrangements, storage solutions, data sharing possibilities etc.\nThe initial overall GUTS DMP was written in September 2022 and approved by NWO. We will update the plan regularly.\nFor specific GUTS projects, the project leads should write a project-specific DMP with more detail about how data will be handled within their project. We are planning to write guidelines for specific projects once the overall data management structure for GUTS is in place (Summer 2024)."

    "title": "13  How to convert your data to GUTS standards",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This chapter has been written in order to ensure that all GUTS data can be considered as one massive dataset, by having all sites convert their data in the same way. The following data types will be covered:\n\n\n\nQuestionnaires\n(f)MRI\nEEG\nESM\nBiological and Genetic data\n\n\n\nPicture: Data Conversion / xkcd / CC BY-NC 2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestionnaire data\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.\nDownload the raw data from qualtrics as a .sav and rename the file to DATE_gutscohortlocation_raw.sav (e.g. 20231211_guts-eur_raw.sav). The extension .sav is used to ensure that Qualtrics gives the right output, as .csv or .tsv sometimes gives faulty output. The cleaned file will not be a .sav file.\nMake a copy of this file and store it in a secure folder. This way you have one file that stays as raw data and another you can clean using this handbook as a guide.\nStep 2.\nOpen up Rstudio and create a new RProject, by going to file -&gt; create new project. Select Existing Directory and navigate to the secure folder where you stored the raw data. Create a new .R file, by going to File -&gt; new file -&gt; R script. Name this file appropriately (e.g. guts-eur_questionnaire_cleaning) and save it in the same folder.\nStep 3.\nThis will begin the R coding side of the data cleaning. A template of the final R script will be provided. Open up your R file and load up the haven and tidyverse libraries by typing:\n#load in necessary libraries\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nand press SHIFT+Enter (if you haven’t installed these libraries yet, write the following line into the console below and press Enter)\ninstall.packages('haven')\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\nLoad in the raw dataset:\n#load in necessary libraries\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#load in raw dataset\nguts_raw &lt;- read.sav(\"20231211_guts-eur_raw.sav\")\nStep 4.\nAll variables that give unnecessary (e.g. startdate, duration in seconds) or sensitive information (e.g. LocationLongitude/Latitude) must be removed. These unwanted variables are present in column 1:9 and 14:17. Remove them and reorder the columns so that the ExternalReference (which is usefull to the participant id) is the first column. You can do this by adding the following lines to your script:\n#subset of relevant columns and reorder\nguts_raw &lt;- guts_raw[,c(13,10:12,18:685)]\nMake sure that these variable numbers line up with your raw data file, they may differ from this example. The variables that should remain are:\n\nExternalReference\nRecipientLastName\nRecipientFirstName\nRecipientEmail\nDemographic variables, including Date of Birth, Age, sex, gender, …. all the way to SES variables (around column 118)\nAll research questionnaire data (the rest of the questionnaire).\n\nNote: the name and email variables, together with the ExternalReference/participant id will be transferred to a separate file (and stored separately from the data) in a later stage, to serve as a contact list for future waves and payment.\nStep 5.\nMake sure that all duplicates are removed and that if both entries have the same amount of progress, only the last entry should remain. Also remove all entries without data, this includes entries that only provided demographic data but did not respond to any questionnaire.\nAll data coming in from Qualtrics will have to be pseudoanonymized. Make sure to remove any directly identifying information including:\n……….\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)MRI data\n\n\n\n\n\nBIDSCoiner, Coming Soon TM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEEG data\n\n\n\n\n\nComing Soon TM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESM data\n\n\n\n\n\nComing Soon TM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological and Genetic data\n\n\n\n\n\nComing Soon TM"

First and foremost, the goal is to facilitate data management within the GUTS consortium. Second, we hope that this handbook might be useful for other projects. We are building upon resources and wisdom of many others, we hope to pay it forward by making this resource openly available.\nThe GUTS consortium investigates youth from the perspective of societal neuroscience, and combines insights and expertise from neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and sociology.
