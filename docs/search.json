First and foremost, the goal is to facilitate data management within the GUTS consortium. Second, we hope that this handbook might be useful for other projects. We are building upon resources and wisdom of many others, we hope to pay it forward by making this resource openly available.\nThe GUTS consortium investigates youth from the perspective of societal neuroscience, and combines insights and expertise from neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and sociology. The consortium is funded by a Gravitation grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science for a ten-year period (2023-2033). To learn more about GUTS visit https://www.gutsproject.com/."

    "title": "8  Specific naming conventions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As mentioned in the general naming conventions section, naming should be both human as well as machine readable. Most of this can be solved by using BIDS as explained in the previous section, however there are some GUTS-specific naming conventions that need to be adhered to.\n\n\nMeasure names in file names\n\nTo adhere to the machine-readable condition, file names of measure data should always include \"_task-[]_\". The short name (here you can find a list of all measure names) of the measure should be used to ensure each collection site uses the same measure name. For example, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index has short name “iri”. Its filename will therefore always include \"_task-iri_\".\n\n\n\nSessions\n\nSessions will be named according to the BIDS standard, meaning that they start with 'ses-'.\nCohorts A, B, and D will collect data in year 2, 5 and 8. The respective sessions will be called:\n'ses-y02', 'ses-y05', 'ses-y08'.\nCohort C will collect data twice a year from year 2 to 8:\n\nFor the first sessions of a year:\nses-y02, ses-y03, ses-y04, ses-y05, ses-y06, ses-y07, ses-y08\nFor the second sessions of a year:\nses-y02-m2, ses-y03-m2,ses-y04-m2,ses-y05-m2,ses-y06-m2,ses-y07-m2,ses-y08-m2\n\n\n\n\nSubject IDs\n\nThe subject ID naming convention differs slightly for each of the data storage locations. To prevent accidental overlap between collected data between WPs, an abbreviation of the location will be added to each subject ID, as can been seen below.\nAs approximately 400-800 subjects will participate at each location, we advise to use a number between 0 and 800. The subject id number should always consists of three numbers, e.g., subject 1 will get the number 001, subject 15 will get the number 015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData storage location\nSubject ID naming convention\nExample\n\n\n\n\nErasmus University Rotterdam (EUR)\nsub-guts-eur-#\nsub-guts-eur-001\n\n\nLeiden University (LEI)\nsub-guts-lei-#\nsub-guts-lei-001\n\n\nVrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU)\nsub-guts-vu-#\nsub-guts-vu-001\n\n\nUniversiteit van Amsterdam (UVA)\nsub-guts-uva-#\nsub-guts-uva-001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile names\n\nTo prevent duplicate file names, each data collection site has to add their abbreviation to the file name. For brain imaging data, the location will be included in the subjectid in the file name, e.g., sub-guts-eur-001_ses-y02_task-feedback_run-01.nii. For other data the location needs to be added separately. The file name for the Interpersonal Reactivity Index could, for example, be `guts-lei_ses-y02_task-iri.tsv’.\n\n\n\nVariable naming conventions\n\nWe propose the following naming conventions for tabular data. The variable- and value labels can be added to either an SPSS file and later be converted to a .tsv file + .json file, or be manually added to a .json file directly. For more information, about how to make .json files see [].\n[session]_[task]_[subpart task]_q/t[question/trial #]\n\nNames: lowercase letters with all distinct information separated by an_underscore\nLabels: Full sentences starting with a capital letter.\nValue labels: lowercase letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable name\nVariable label\nValue labels\n\n\n\n\nses-y02_iri_pt_q3\nInterpersonal Reactivity Index - Perspective taking scale Q3: I sometimes find it difficult to see things from the other guy’s point of view.\n0 = does not describe me very well, 4 = described me very well\n\n\nses-y02_dailyhassles_freq_q4\nParenting Daily Hassles scale - Frequency Q4: The kids won’t listen or do what they are asked without being nagged.\n1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = constantly\n\n\nses-y05_pcg_exb1_perc_to2\nProsocial Cyberball Task - Exclusion Block 1: Percentage of throws to player 2.\n\n\n\nses-y05_dd_money_ind_day180\nDelay Discounting Money: Indifference point day 180: Prefer to receive this amount of money now than 10 euros in 180 days.\n\n\n\nses-y02_saliva_cort_d1_m1\nSaliva Samples -Cortisol: Mean cortisol in nmol/l day 1, measurement 1."
