    "section": "",
    "text": "This chapter has been written in order to ensure that all GUTS data can be considered as one massive dataset, by having all sites convert their data in the same way. The following data types will be covered:\n\n\n\nEEG\nESM\n(f)MRI\nBiological and Genetic data\nQuestionnaires\n\n\n\nPicture: Data Conversion / xkcd / CC BY-NC 2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestionnaire data\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.\nDownload the raw data from qualtrics as a .sav and rename the file to DATE_gutscohortlocation_raw.sav (e.g. 20231211_guts-eur_raw.sav). The extension .sav is used to ensure that Qualtrics gives the right output, as .csv or .tsv sometimes gives faulty output. The cleaned file will not be a .sav file.\nMake a copy of this file and store it in a secure folder. This way you have one file that stays as raw data and another you can clean using this handbook as a guide.\nStep 2.\nOpen up Rstudio and create a new RProject, by going to file -&gt; create new project. Select Existing Directory and navigate to the secure folder where you stored the raw data. Create a new .R file, by going to File -&gt; new file -&gt; R script. Name this file appropriately (e.g. guts-eur_questionnaire_cleaning) and save it in the same folder.\nStep 3.\nThis will begin the R coding side of the data cleaning. A template of the final R script will be provided. Open up your R file and load up the haven and tidyverse libraries by typing:\n#load in necessary libraries\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nand press SHIFT+Enter (if you haven’t installed these libraries yet, write the following line into the console below and press Enter)\ninstall.packages('haven')\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\nLoad in the raw dataset:\n#load in necessary libraries\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#load in raw dataset\nguts_raw &lt;- read.sav(\"20231211_guts-eur_raw.sav\")\nStep 4.\nAll variables that give unnecessary (e.g. startdate, duration in seconds) or sensitive information (e.g. LocationLongitude/Latitude) must be removed. These unwanted variables are present in column 1:9 and 14:17. Remove them and reorder the columns so that the ExternalReference (which is usefull to the participant id) is the first column. You can do this by adding the following lines to your script:\n#subset of relevant columns and reorder\nguts_raw &lt;- guts_raw[,c(13,10:12,18:685)]\nMake sure that these variable numbers line up with your raw data file, they may differ from this example. The variables that should remain are:\n\nExternalReference\nRecipientLastName\nRecipientFirstName\nRecipientEmail\nDemographic variables, including Date of Birth, Age, sex, gender, …. all the way to SES variables (around column 118)\nAll research questionnaire data (the rest of the questionnaire).\n\nNote: the name and email variables, together with the ExternalReference/participant id will be transferred to a separate file (and stored separately from the data) in a later stage, to serve as a contact list for future waves and payment.\nStep 5.\nMake sure that all duplicates are removed and that if both entries have the same amount of progress, only the last entry should remain. Also remove all entries without data, this includes entries that only provided demographic data but did not respond to any questionnaire.\nAll data coming in from Qualtrics will have to be pseudoanonymized. Make sure to remove any directly identifying information including:\n……….\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRI data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRI data"

    "title": "8  Specific naming conventions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As mentioned in the general naming conventions section, naming should be both human as well as machine readable. Most of this can be solved by using BIDS as explained in the previous section, however there are some GUTS-specific naming conventions that need to be adhered to.\n\n\nMeasure names in file names\n\nTo adhere to the machine-readable condition, file names of measure data should always include \"_task-[]_\". The short name (here you can find a list of all measure names) of the measure should be used to ensure each collection site uses the same measure name. For example, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index has short name “iri”. Its filename will therefore always include \"_task-iri_\".\n\n\n\nSessions\n\nSessions will be named according to the BIDS standard, meaning that they start with 'ses-'.\nCohorts A, B, and D will collect data in year 2, 5 and 8. The respective sessions will be called:\n'ses-y02', 'ses-y05', 'ses-y08'.\nCohort C will collect data twice a year from year 2 to 8:\n\nFor the first sessions of a year:\nses-y02, ses-y03, ses-y04, ses-y05, ses-y06, ses-y07, ses-y08\nFor the second sessions of a year:\nses-y02-m2, ses-y03-m2,ses-y04-m2,ses-y05-m2,ses-y06-m2,ses-y07-m2,ses-y08-m2\n\n\n\n\nSubject IDs\n\nThe subject ID naming convention differs slightly for each of the data storage locations. To prevent accidental overlap between collected data between WPs, an abbreviation of the location will be added to each subject ID, as can been seen below.\nAs approximately 400-800 subjects will participate at each location, we advise to use a number between 0 and 800. The subject id number should always consists of three numbers, e.g., subject 1 will get the number 001, subject 15 will get the number 015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData storage location\nSubject ID naming convention\nExample\n\n\n\n\nErasmus University Rotterdam (EUR)\nsub-guts-eur-#\nsub-guts-eur-001\n\n\nLeiden University (LEI)\nsub-guts-lei-#\nsub-guts-lei-001\n\n\nVrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU)\nsub-guts-vu-#\nsub-guts-vu-001\n\n\nUniversiteit van Amsterdam (UVA)\nsub-guts-uva-#\nsub-guts-uva-001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile names\n\nTo prevent duplicate file names, each data collection site has to add their abbreviation to the file name. For brain imaging data, the location will be included in the subjectid in the file name, e.g., sub-guts-eur-001_ses-y02_task-feedback_run-01.nii. For other data the location needs to be added separately. The file name for the Interpersonal Reactivity Index could, for example, be `guts-lei_ses-y02_task-iri.tsv’.\n\n\n\nVariable naming conventions\n\nWe propose the following naming conventions for tabular data. The variable- and value labels can be added to either an SPSS file and later be converted to a .tsv file + .json file, or be manually added to a .json file directly. For more information, about how to make .json files see [].\n[session]_[task]_[subpart task]_q/t[question/trial #]\n\nNames: lowercase letters with all distinct information separated by an_underscore\nLabels: Full sentences starting with a capital letter.\nValue labels: lowercase letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable name\nVariable label\nValue labels\n\n\n\n\nses-y02_iri_pt_q3\nInterpersonal Reactivity Index - Perspective taking scale Q3: I sometimes find it difficult to see things from the other guy’s point of view.\n0 = does not describe me very well, 4 = described me very well\n\n\nses-y02_dailyhassles_freq_q4\nParenting Daily Hassles scale - Frequency Q4: The kids won’t listen or do what they are asked without being nagged.\n1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = constantly\n\n\nses-y05_pcg_exb1_perc_to2\nProsocial Cyberball Task - Exclusion Block 1: Percentage of throws to player 2.\n\n\n\nses-y05_dd_money_ind_day180\nDelay Discounting Money: Indifference point day 180: Prefer to receive this amount of money now than 10 euros in 180 days.\n\n\n\nses-y02_saliva_cort_d1_m1\nSaliva Samples -Cortisol: Mean cortisol in nmol/l day 1, measurement 1."

This RDM Handbook and all other efforts to streamline the organization of the data within the GUTS consortium is all aimed to make working with this data as seamless as possible.\nOpen Science and collaboration are very important pillars of the GUTS project. Good data management is vital to facilitate collaboration within the consortium, and eventually also with researchers outside the consortium.\nWe are planning to use a “FAIR from the start” approach, which means that we are striving to unify data collection and data processing from the start. This will allow us to build a database including a metadata explorer that shows the data in various ways. In this way, once the data is collected and processed, it can be unlocked by researchers to analyse it thoroughly and safely.\n\n\n\n\nBriney, Kristin, Heather Coates, and Abigail Goben. 2020. “Foundational Practices of Research Data Management.” Research Ideas and Outcomes 6 (July): e56508. https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e56508."
