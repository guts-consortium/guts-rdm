    "text": "Research Data Management (RDM) considers the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project. It covers a wide range of activities such as initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing. This means that the list of benefits of doing this well is quite extensive as well. Here we provide a non-exhaustive list of benefits:\n\nproper data storage and backup prevents data loss\nmaking data understandable for others (and your future self) allows reuse and collaboration\nproper data management is key to Open Science, since transparency and reuse of data is only possible using well-documented data\ngood RDM also helps to prevent misconduct since it helps to show the integrity of the data collection process\nit makes research go more smoothly, allowing you as a researcher to focus on the problems of science rather than data administravia (Briney, Coates, and Goben 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nBriney, Kristin, Heather Coates, and Abigail Goben. 2020. “Foundational Practices of Research Data Management.” Research Ideas and Outcomes 6 (July): e56508. https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e56508."
