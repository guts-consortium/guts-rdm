    "text": "Research Data Management (RDM) considers the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project. It covers a wide range of activities such as initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing. This means that the list of benefits of doing this well is quite extensive as well. Here we provide a non-exhaustive list of benefits:\n\nproper data storage and backup prevents data loss\nmaking data understandable for others (and your future self) allows reuse and collaboration\nproper data management is key to Open Science, since transparency and reuse of data is only possible using well-documented data\ngood RDM also helps to prevent misconduct since it helps to show the integrity of the data collection process\nit makes research go more smoothly, allowing you as a researcher to focus on the problems of science rather than data administravia (Briney, Coates, and Goben 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nBriney, Kristin, Heather Coates, and Abigail Goben. 2020. “Foundational Practices of Research Data Management.” Research Ideas and Outcomes 6 (July): e56508. https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e56508."

Metadata is of importance to every step in the FAIR principle;\n\nMetadata makes data Findable by being able to search for certain metadata ‘chunks’.\nAccessibility to the data is determined by or can be found in the metadata.\nMetadata makes data Interoperable so you can have your data operate with other systems, in our case a metadata explorer and our storage/distribution system.\nMetadata describes the data in such a way that you can reliably Re-use the data for your/their own research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture: [FAIR principles](https://www.ugent.be/img/doza/beleid/fair-data.png) / Patrick Hochstenbach / [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n\n6.0.1 GUTS\nOur metadata is shown in our metadata explorer [insert HTML link] and is divided in the following ways;\n\nGeneral overview of the data including waves and general description\nParticipant information including N, number of dropouts and other general participant information per wave\nMeasure overview including measure name, category, description and type per measure and per wave\n\nThis explorer will include a search function to find and select variables required for your research. These variables along with certain preset filters (age, wave, gender, etc.) can then be made into a package which and be requested for analysis."
