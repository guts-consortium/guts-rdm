# How to convert your data to Yoda standards

This chapter has been written in order to ensure that all GUTS data can be considered as one massive dataset, by having all sites convert their data in the same way. The following data types will be covered:

-   EEG
-   ESM
-   (f)MRI
-   Biological and Genetic data
-   Questionnaires

1.  All variables that give unnecessary information like longitude/latitude values should be deleted including:

-   StartDate
-   EndDate
-   Status
-   IPAddress
-   Progress
-   Duration\_\_in_seconds
-   Finished
-   RecordedDate
-   ......

2.  Make sure that all duplicates are removed and that if both entries have the same amount of progress, only the last entry should remain. Also remove all entries without data, this includes entries that only provided demographic data but did not respond to any questionnaire.

3.  All data coming in from qualtrics will have to be anonymized. Make sure to remove any directly identifying information including:

-   Name(s)
-   Surname(s)
-   Email address
