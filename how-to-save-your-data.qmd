# How to convert your data to GUTS standards

This chapter has been written in order to ensure that all GUTS data can be considered as one massive dataset, by having all sites convert their data in the same way. The following data types will be covered:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Questionnaires
-   (f)MRI
-   EEG
-   Behavioral data
-   Physiological data (e.g., ecg, skin conductance, dynanometer output)
-   ESM
-   Hormone and Genetic data

## Questionnaire data

[Step 1.]{.underline}\
Download the raw data from qualtrics as a .sav and rename the file to DATE_guts*cohortlocation*\_raw.sav (e.g. 20231211_guts-eur_raw.sav). The extension .sav is used to ensure that Qualtrics gives the right output, as .csv or .tsv sometimes gives faulty output. The cleaned file will not be a .sav file.\
Make a copy of this file and store it in a secure folder. This way you have one file that stays as raw data and another you can clean using this handbook as a guide.

[Step 2.]{.underline}\
Open up Rstudio and create a new RProject, by going to file -\> create new project. Select Existing Directory and navigate to the secure folder where you stored the raw data. Create a new .R file, by going to File -\> new file -\> R script. Name this file appropriately (e.g. guts-eur_questionnaire_cleaning) and save it in the same folder.

[Step 3.]{.underline}\
This will begin the R coding side of the data cleaning. A template of the final R script will be provided. Open up your R file and load up the haven and tidyverse libraries by typing:

``` r
#load in necessary libraries
library(haven)
library(tidyverse)
```

and press SHIFT+Enter (if you haven't installed these libraries yet, write the following line into the console below and press Enter)

``` r
install.packages('haven')
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

Load in the raw dataset:

``` r
#load in necessary libraries
library(haven)
library(tidyverse)

#load in raw dataset
guts_raw <- read.sav("20231211_guts-eur_raw.sav")
```

[Step 4.]{.underline}\
All variables that give unnecessary (e.g. startdate, duration in seconds) or sensitive information (e.g. LocationLongitude/Latitude) must be removed. These unwanted variables are present in column 1:9 and 14:17. Remove them and reorder the columns so that the ExternalReference (which is usefull to the participant id) is the first column. You can do this by adding the following lines to your script:

``` r
#subset of relevant columns and reorder
guts_raw <- guts_raw[,c(13,10:12,18:685)]
```

Make sure that these variable numbers line up with your raw data file, they may differ from this example. The variables that should remain are:

-   ExternalReference

-   RecipientLastName

-   RecipientFirstName

-   RecipientEmail

-   Demographic variables, including Date of Birth, Age, sex, gender, .... all the way to SES variables (around column 118)

-   All research questionnaire data (the rest of the questionnaire).

Note: the name and email variables, together with the ExternalReference/participant id will be transferred to a separate file (and stored separately from the data) in a later stage, to serve as a contact list for future waves and payment.

[Step 5.]{.underline}\
Make sure that all duplicates are removed and that if both entries have the same amount of progress, only the last entry should remain. Also remove all entries without data, this includes entries that only provided demographic data but did not respond to any questionnaire.

All data coming in from Qualtrics will have to be pseudoanonymized. Make sure to remove any directly identifying information including:

# (f)MRI data

Raw output from (f)MRI data might differ between locations, e.g., only DICOM files or .nii, .par and .rec files. Bidsifying (organizing and naming of files according to the BIDS standard), however, should happen in a similar way for all outputs. There are several programs one can use to bidsify data to limit manual labor. See the [BIDS website](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/benefits.html#converters) for more information about options. Please refer to Chapter 12. Specific naming conventions and Chapter 13. Data structure while BIDSyfing. After BIDSifying, a pipeline ([fMRI Prep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/)/[HALFpipe](https://github.com/HALFpipe/HALFpipe)) can be used for further (pre-)processing. A pipeline is currently being developed and will be shared once finished.

# EEG data

Raw output from EEG data might differ between locations depending on programs/materials used. However, BIDSified data should end up looking the same. There are several ways in which EEG data can be automatically BIDSified. (see the [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/benefits.html#converters) website). After BIDSifying, a pipeline can be used for further (pre-)processing. This pipeline is currently being developed and will be shared once finished.

# Behavioral tasks

Behavioral tasks can yield data from tasks during EEG, ECG, (f)MRI, Dynamometer, but also from tasks conducted solely on a computer/e-prime without being linked to any sort of biological/physiological information. For all behavioral tasks, a group-level file has to be created so that group analyses can be performed based on all participants' scores, for example. Additionally, individual files of behavioral tasks will be processed and relocated according to BIDS to facilitate individual analyses.

# Physiological data

Physiological data could include ECG data, skin conductance data, and grip force data (dynamometer). The raw output will differ depending on the programs/materials used. Nonetheless, all output should be BIDSified (named and located according to BIDS standards) before further (pre-)processing.

# ESM data

ESM data will be processed similarly to the Qualtrics questionnaire data.

# Biological and Genetic data

Hair and saliva samples will be send to a lab for analysis. After analysis, you will receive files that should be processed to adhere to the guts standard.
