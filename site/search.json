First and foremost, the goal is to facilitate data management within the GUTS consortium. Second, we hope that this handbook might be useful for other projects. We are building upon resources and wisdom of many others, we hope to pay it forward by making this resource openly available.\nThe GUTS consortium investigates youth from the perspective of societal neuroscience, and combines insights and expertise from neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and sociology.

    "text": "Good and structured file names will help you and your collaborators to easily navigate the content and status of files in your project. Within the GUTS consortium we use file naming conventions from the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for MRI and related files. For all other files, we suggest the following best practices:\nIn general, good file names are (see also Klapwijk (2023)):\n\nMachine-readable:\n\nUse not much more than letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores. Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, and case sensitivity\n\nFor example, paper_flanker-task_draft01.docx is preferred over paper “flanker task” draft01(1).docx\n\nDeliberately use delimiters. Use a hyphen (-) to mean “different words that are part of the same chunk”, and underscore (_) to separate different chunks of metadata\n\nFor example, file names in the BIDS specification nicely follow this principle: the file sub-01_ses-02_task-feedback_run-01.nii contains instances of the “subject”, “ses(sion)”, “task” an “run” entities, making it evident from the filename alone that it contains the nii (nifti) feedback task data for run 01 from session 02 of subject 01\n\n\nHuman-readable:\n\nGood file names provide useful clues to the content, status and version of a file, uniquely identify a file and help in classifying and sorting files\nChoose keywords and file names that are sufficiently descriptive, e.g., analysis01_descriptive-statistics.R,analysis02_preregistered-analysis.R\n\nMake sorting and searching easy:\n\nUse YYYY-MM-DD date format (ISO 8601 standard)\nTo order files put date or number first, e.g., 2019-01-01_original-analysis.R, 2019-12-01_minor-changes-to-original.R, 01_original-analysis.R, 02_minor-changes-to-original.R\nInclude the version of the file, e.g., methodology-section _v1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKlapwijk, Eduard. 2023. “Best Practices for Documenting and Organizing Research Projects,” January. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.7551576."
