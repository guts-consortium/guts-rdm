## Metadata

All data is accompanied by metadata, or data about data. Metadata is of importance to every step in the FAIR principle;

-   Metadata makes data Findable by being able to search for certain metadata 'chunks'.
-   Accessibility to the data is determined by or can be found in the metadata.
-   Metadata makes data Interoperable so you can have your data operate with other systems, in our case a metadata explorer and our storage/distribution system.
-   Metadata describes the data in such a way that you can reliably Re-use the data for your/their own research.

### GUTS

Our metadata is shown in our metadata explorer \[insert HTML link\] and is divided in the following ways;

1.  [General overview]{.underline} of the data including waves and general description

2.  [Participant information]{.underline} including *N,* number of dropouts and other general participant information per wave

3.  [Measure overview]{.underline} including measure name, category, description and type per measure and per wave

This explorer will include a [search function]{.underline} to find and select variables required for your research. These variables along with certain preset filters (age, wave, gender, etc.) can then be made into a package which and be requested for analysis.
